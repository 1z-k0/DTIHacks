# DTIHacks
An app compiled for Windows to show different DTI outfit hacks. If you are here thinking that this is a hacked client for Roblox "Dress to Impress" or some auto-outfit maker, you are in the wrong. This is a small app made using the Scratch engine (sorry gals, too lazy to program) to show different combos and fits for it.
## Installation (Windows)
1. Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/1z-k0/DTIHacks/releases) tab of this project.
2. Download the ZIP file provided.
3. Click on the downloaded file, and extracted.
4. Transfer these files into a memorable location.
5. Boom, you have successfully installed DTIHacks.
## Features
Currently, DTIHacks has no features. This will change when further updates to this application arrive. I expect to have at least the scrolling system for rating outfits, and another one for looking through tips, tricks and hacks. 
## Adding Outfits
To add your outfit, you can either A) make a project on scratch and add it here: https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/32178708, or B) suggest it in the Discord server: https://discord.gg/R6ReWgXM
### Thanks for reading this, and have a great time using DTIHacks!
